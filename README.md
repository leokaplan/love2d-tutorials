# love2d-tutorials


This is a series of tutorials aiming to teach game development using the Löve2d Engine.
The course is based around projects, which we will be building from scratch and with small steps.

I assume basic programming experience (a introductory course that covers variables, loops and functions is more than enough).

After cloning/downloading,
 The recommended workflow is:
 * Choose a project
 * Go to the project folder
  * For each file, starting with the lowest number and increasing
    * Run it - watch it running, interact if prompt to.
    * Open it - preferrebly in an editor with syntax highlight 
    * Read the comments - all of them
    * Do the proposed exercises - even the "experiment!" and "try it!" ones

I will not write about how to install and configure and run applications, I think there is enough material on the web about it.
