# love2d-tutorials


This is a series of tutorials aiming to teach game development using the LÃ¶ve2d Engine.
The course is based around projects, which we will be building from scratch and with small steps.
The recommended workflow is:
  * Go to the project folder
  * For each file, starting with the lowest number and increasing
    * Run it
    * Open it
    * Read the comments
    * Do the proposed exercises 

I will not write about how to install and configure and run applications, I think there is enough material on the web about it.
